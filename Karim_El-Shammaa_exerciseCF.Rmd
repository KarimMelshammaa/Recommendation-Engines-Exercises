========================================================

# Initialization

Import libraries

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Load the critics dataset.

```{r}

critics <- read.csv("D:/IE Material/Term II/Recommendation Engines/IE-Lab1-Package/Building a Collaborative Filtering Engine/Problem/critics.csv")
```

# 1) Pearson correlation coefficient 
Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between Victoria and Nuria

**Expected correlation between Victoria and Nuria**: 0.3651484

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}

# Subsetting rows containing Victoria and Nuria and removing NAs
nv = critics %>%
  filter(User == 'Victoria' | User == 'Nuria') %>%
  select_if(colSums(is.na(.)) == 0)

# Setting the rownames
rownames(nv) = c("Nuria", "Victoria")

# Removing the User column
nv = nv %>%
  select(-User)

# Converting the new vector to a dataframe
nv = as.data.frame(nv)

# Converting the values to Numeric
vic = as.numeric(nv[2,c(1:8)])
nur = as.numeric(nv[1,c(1:8)])

# Computing the Pearson Correlation
y = cor(vic, nur, method = "pearson")

# Printing the Results
print(paste("Expected correlation between Victoria and Nuria:", round(y,7)))

```

# 2) Compare two movie critics
Using the calculated Pearson correlation in the previous section. Compare and show the movie ratings for Victoria and Nuria on a scatter plot. How is this compared with the same ratings of Maria and Nerea on a scatter plot? What about Chris and Jim? What it means?

# Adding a line of best-fit to visualize the correlation

# There seems to be a high correlation between Chris and Jim
